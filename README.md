Coupled ROMS-CICE with COIN data assimilation

The combined optimal interpolation and nudging (COIN) method is used for 
data assimilation. The assimilation of sea ice concentration has been 
included in the official metroms version, see https://github.com/metno/metroms.   

Here we document the development of the COIN method for assimilation of 
sea ice concentration and other ocean and sea ice variables.
