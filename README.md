Coupled ROMS-CICE with COIN data assimilation

This repository documents the development of the combined optimal interpolation
and nudging (COIN) method for data assimilation in the coupled ROMS-CICE model. 
The COIN assimilation of sea ice concentration has been included in the official
metroms version, https://github.com/metno/metroms. Here the development of the
COIN method for assimilation of other ocean and sea ice variables is documented.
